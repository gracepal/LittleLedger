# LittleLedger

> A log of all the little things üê•

### Overview

**LittleLedger** is basically a **starter blueprint** for an app that we hope will make life easier for new parents. It's built for **moms and dads** who are dealing with the overwhelming job of newborn care.

The main idea is to give you one easy spot to manage all the little daily logistics. That means:

1. **Keeping track of baby products** (like wipes and diapers) with details and direct links so you can reorder fast when you're running low.

2. **Logging those critical daily events**-‚Äîthink diaper changes, nap times, and feedings.

This version is just the **initial prototype** with the basic screen layouts (the UI) in place. I used AI to help build the code quickly for this class project, so it's a minimal structure right now. It's the foundation we'd need to add the real, working features later on.
